# Calculator, Multiplication table & Interest calculator 

Calculator - is a development for working with arithmetic operations such as:
#### I used arithmetic operations like:
```C#
< + > - addition
< - > - subtraction
< * > - multiplication
< * > - division
< % > - remainde of the number
```
Multiplication is the process of calculating the product of two or more numbers.
```C#
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
...
```
The percentage calculator allows you to make any calculations with percentages: finding the percentage of the number, how many percent is the number "X" of the number "Y".
```C#
5% of 25 = 1.25
...
```
#### Types
```C#
int & double & string & char
```
#### Functions:
```C#
Output to console: Console.WriteLine();
Intput from console: Console.ReadLine();
Converts: Convert.ToDouble();
```
#### Operators:
```C#
switch
```
The ***switch*** statement provides multidirectional branching in the program.

```C#
if(){...}
else{...}
```

The ***if-else*** construct is able to check one or more conditions, and if the condition is not true, then execute another code or check another condition.

```C#
while(){...}
for(){...}
```
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

The ***while*** loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is True:
```C#
while (condition) 
{
  // code block to be executed
}
```

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the ***for*** loop instead of a ***while*** loop:
```C#
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) 
{
  // code block to be executed
}
```

**Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

```C#
try{...}
catch(){...}
```

```C#
Methods
static void Name(){...}
```

`Called Methods:`

```C#
Classes
public class CalculatR{...}
```

`Constructor:`

*Constructor* is a special method of the class which gets automatically invoked whenever an instance of the class is created.

`Class Inheritance:`

In C#, *inheritance* allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

Also in the code i used ***Escape Characters*** - replacement of control characters in the text with corresponding text substitutions.

## Release Notes
In the [old](https://github.com/ZafarUrakov/NewCalculator/tree/refactore/v.2) version , we have updated and simplified the code with methods, classes and other properties..

As for this version we also added and simplified the code using the Interfaces and we have added new function "PRC - percentage counter", PRC will help you calculate the percentage of the amounts you entered.You can also see changes in the code like:

- Added Classes:
  - Constructor:
