# NewCalculator

Calculator - is a development for working with arithmetic operations such as:
#### I used arithmetic operations like:
```C#
< + > - addition
< - > - subtraction
< * > - multiplication
< * > - division
< % > - remainde of the number
```

#### Types
```C#
double & string & char
```
#### Operators:
```C#
switch
```
The ***switch*** statement provides multidirectional branching in the program.
```C#
if(){...}
else{...}
```

The ***if-else*** construct is able to check one or more conditions, and if the condition is not true, then execute another code or check another condition.

#### Functions:
```C#
Output to console: Console.WriteLine();
Intput from console: Console.ReadLine();
Converts: Convert.ToDouble();
```
Also in the code i used ***Escape Characters*** - replacement of control characters in the text with corresponding text substitutions.

## Release Notes
In the [first](https://github.com/ZafarUrakov/NewCalculator/tree/releases/v1.0) , we used arithmetic operations with input and output to the console. We also did not have to choose an action.

As for this version , you may notice changes in the code like:

- Logical operators such as switch and if-else have benn added.
- Simplified the code.
- Fixed the errors.

This not all , there will be changes soon.

You can take my code and try it yourself üëáüèª
